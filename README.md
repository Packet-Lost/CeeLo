# CeeLo in Python 3

In an effort to learn python I wrote up a quick implementation of the dice game CeeLo.

A lot of these functions I hope to reuse in a Raspberry Pi project, but that will just be a scoreboard.

# Ideas for future improvements

Ask for number of players up front

Customize player names

Randomize/shuffle who shoots first on the come out roll of the game

Winner of last game shoots first next game

Edit player names

Edit misentered roll scores
